# Jarvis AI assistant

Jarvis is a conversational AI assistant built using the Groq API and the LLaMA model (LLaMA 3-70B) for natural language understanding and response generation. Jarvis can interact with users in real-time and speak its responses using the pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine. This project serves as an engaging example of integrating AI with voice interaction.

### Features

##### Conversational AI: Jarvis can respond to user inputs in real-time, maintaining context across multiple interactions for a more engaging conversation.
##### Text-to-Speech: Utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text responses into speech, allowing for a more interactive experience.
##### Customizable AI Behavior: The AI's behavior can be defined through a customizable system prompt, enabling tailored responses based on user needs.
##### Exit: Simply type go to sleep to stop the assistant without any abrupt interruptions.
